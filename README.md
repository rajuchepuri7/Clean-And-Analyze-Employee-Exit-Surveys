# Clean-And-Analyze-Employee-Exit-Surveys

In this project, we'll clean and analyze exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) body of the Queensland government in Australia. The TAFE exit survey can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).

We'll pretend our stakeholders want us to combine the results for both surveys to answer the following question:
 - Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
 - Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
 
 We will aim to answer the frist question, by cleaning and anlyzing the datasets.
